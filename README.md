     With a goal of a Bachelor's of Computer Science, my second collegiate degree, as I've already a 2009 awarded B.S. of Computers Networking & Information Technology from Purdue University, I hope to capitalize on the structural integrity of functional language programming, with web-working logical potential having discovered, on the Friday post Easter 2020, a language. 

     With functional aspects, although it is symbolic in metaphorical sense only, it is a transactional database language of semaphore and likely a binary library to interpret in pattern match differentials and the layered un-deletion of files flawlessly with some easy-to-build computer desktop/tower power-supplies. Although I did programming in my undergraduate, my focus was on systems. This language, for they in the processing houses of large, reel-to-reel card programming performance competitions, was known as Sharp#s; exposure to current Computer Science will ensure I am not poorly performing that task. With near flawless "institutional knowledge" as far as software is concerned given that, to the staff,  as the index cards were column and row hole, pre-punched, the sorting method, paired with how well they prevented 'data-un-silo-housing'

 the May-Bell Phone System supporting modern 911 'forever can connect','erlange', the Elixir and Phoenix framework expression, an Open-Source software pair, presented on that Saturday, a moment of confirmation that the logistics applied during that era of software shuffle house sorting catalogs of counter-data, all the card stock in columns but to them "it's just hole punched pieces of paper", had a software to sort, silo, shift, and organize that allows for block data usage in a way that paired with nearly 250 lines of code, a near infinite software-canabalizer may be born. I threw up Easter Chocolate at 2am that Saturday. 

  With topics of introduction as hard as they are, TEACHING Computer Science or 'web-programming' to Elementary Students, as Erlang is Web-Browser friendly, feels like a natural by-product to fulfill my lifelong goal of supplying a computer structure, independent of Human language, to enable a case study: North Korean Children being EASILY allowed a computer language and web-application tutorial from an American into their own language, at their own discretion, because the coding is so simple. Quite literally, an easily peaceful negotiation that with Erlang and Elixir being an independent interaction of English and their faximilied system language as Erlang is internationally popular from even the 1980's, there would be no Korean, there, without competent & strong programming skills in and throughout their primary education. If such a gift could befall the United Nations even handedly, I would no doubt be thrilled that the potential such an amazing software would gift a people in terms of
